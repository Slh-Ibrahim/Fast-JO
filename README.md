“Body Mass Index (BMI) --------------------- **BMI** (Body Mass Index) is a widely-used metric that assesses a person's body weight relative to their height. It provides a simple calculation that helps estimate overall body tissue mass and categorizes individuals into four groups: **underweight**, **normal weight**, **overweight**, or **obese**, based on predefined ranges. BMI serves as a general health indicator to determine if an individual's weight is within a healthy range for their height.”
